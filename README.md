# Surfpy #
Surfpy is a simple python script to quickly search things on the web from
the command line.<br/>
It is similar to surfraw, but with much less features.

Configuration is done in the script itself and adding new tags is very easy.<br/>

## TODO ##
- subprocess watcher for browser instances
    - bait and switch (replace current browser windows with new ones consisting of the script output)
- combined searchbar & addressbar behavior
- incorporation into surf
    - dwm colorscheme consistency
